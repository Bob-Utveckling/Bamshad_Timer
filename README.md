# Bamshad_Timer
A Timer application in Java for note and time checks

This handy Java application helps track time at a task at hand.
The timer will track the time taken while enabling note taking.
It can be useful for persons who need to track and report the time it takes for certain tasks.
The timer is flexible and allows for personal time updates while the timer runs. It will also copy notes and the tracked time to clipboard if needed.

An example video of the app can be found at:

Please drop me a note if interested. The app uses JavaFX Packager for JDK 18.
