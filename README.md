# Bamshad_Timer
A Timer application in Java for note and time checks

This handy Java application helps track time at a task at hand.
The timer will track the time taken while enabling note taking.
It can be useful for persons who need to track and report the time it took for a certain task.
The timer is flexible and allows for personal time updates to the timer as well as enabling copy-to-clipboad when making notes and tracking time.

An example video of the app can be found at:

Please drop me a note if interested. The app uses JavaFX Packager for JDK 18.
